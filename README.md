# DVS-project

I chose project suggestion of artifying photographs because I enjoy pop arts. The function requires a photo and the name of the resulting image file as inputs, and will produce a decorative picture as output.

I searched for some pop art pictures as references and decided on having 4 colours in the output. K means is used to determine the 4 colours used in the resulting picture. Closing is used to reduce the details of the photo so that it looks more like itâ€™s being painted.
